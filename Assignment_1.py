# 10,1,8,3,6,5,4,7,x,y
# The general solution for x is x=n-5 where n is previous number
# The general solution for y is y=n+7 where n is previous number. So y=x+7
# Algorithm
# step1: start
# step2: Find the value of n
# step3: Use x=n-5 to find the value of x
# step4: Use y=x+7 to find the value of y
# step5: stop

# Floor division
x=9
y=3
print(x//y)
a=9
b=4
print(a//b)
c=9
d=10
print(c//d)
